This repository contains solutions for Homework 2.

Question 1: Posterior Distribution Updates

Analyze sequential updates of a posterior distribution using a Binomial likelihood and uniform prior. Demonstrates parameter updates as observations are added.

Question 2: Bayesian Multi-Armed Bandit (Two Arms)

Implement a Bayesian Multi-Armed Bandit algorithm to determine which of two entities has a higher success probability, balancing exploration and exploitation.

Question 3: Independent vs. Joint Analysis (Three Entities)

Compare two approaches for analyzing three entities: independent Beta-Binomial analysis and a joint Dirichlet-Multinomial model, with visualizations for both.
